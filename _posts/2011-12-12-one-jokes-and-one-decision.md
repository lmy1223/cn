记得去年十月份，学校开迎新晚会的时候，听到一个笑话，很是好笑，所以记得特别清楚。

“一个厦大的高材生，学习很是刻苦，都大学毕业了还没有去过中山路。于是决定在毕业前去逛一下来厦旅游必去的中山路。果不其然——迷路了。但是该高材生很聪明，看到两个戴着眼镜，穿着校服的学妹，便去问路，‘请问？我要怎样才能去厦大？’，学妹说：‘读书，努力读书，拼命读书，并且还要考试发挥正常’”。

今天看书看到一个类似的笑话，刚开始还没有反应过来。仔细看了一遍以后，发现跟上面这个笑话有异曲同工之妙。
 
A visitor who has become lost in New York,with tickets in hand to a piano recital. Stopping a passerby, the visitor asks,"Excuse me, Can you tell me how to get to Carnegie Hall?" The answer: "Practice!".
 
The author of 《Accelerated C++》 has wrote in the end of that book: As you look for reading materimal, keep in mind that books on the shelf do not make you a better programmer. Ultimately, the only way to improve your programming is to write programs.Have fun! I exactly consent to the author,and I have make up my mind to code the example of books which I have read. Of course, the book deserve to read seriously.
